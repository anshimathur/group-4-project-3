Unknown Speaker  0:15  
It's all feeling.

Unknown Speaker  0:17  
Are you excited?

Speaker 1  0:21  
Yep, so this is, this is your time to rise and shine together, right, without hand holding from your instructor or teaching staff, right? I mean, I remember, like few years back when I was in this position, I mean, in the same, same position as you guys are now, it was an amazing feeling, like I was learning things, lot of things that I didn't know in the first place. And then there comes a time where I can basically show like all the glory and dazzle and everything right, and then basically try to prove what we have learned. So anyway, so project time for me, at least, also very interesting, also another thing I have seen over last few years teaching the boot camp lot of time students go well above and beyond the expectation that either BCS sets on you guys, or even sometimes maybe as an instructor, I expect, right? I mean, time and time again, students kind of amazed me by producing the kind of work that, frankly speaking, even probably very few people would think that they could do that at the first week when they were starting the boot camp. And I'm sure we'll probably see the same thing repeating again. Last in the last class, I did speak to each of your group, and all of the groups were actually on the right track. Some of the groups are where I saw very well organized. You guys already have started a written form what your idea is. Some groups were probably still in kind of brainstorming says phase, but all of you guys were kind of thinking in the right track, right So, and plus, because we kind of rushed through some of the activities that that that could be rushed through, so we are having one extra day. So that means today is basically your bonus. So after today, then you will have another three and two, another five days of work, right? So we should be really good. Now I'll obviously let you guys break into your rooms, but before that, what I wanted to show here is, this is basically the guidance from the VCRs, like what the project one should be. And some people asked me, or maybe they thought that, since during the last week of classes, I kind of emphasized too much on time series forecasting, like whether it has to be absolutely something to do with the forecasting model, anything right? And I said, No, that is not the case, because that's what I know from my previous boot camps as well, that in the first project, there is no expectation that students will actually do some machine learning model if some groups end up doing that's fine. But here, if you look into this slide show, it basically clearly mentions the expectation here. So first here in this slide, you would you can see that they are saying, Hey, you can choose project from finance, healthcare, technology. Or these are some examples. Feel free to find your own right. You can, you can you can basically choose something from meteorology, like climate data, like any data, basically that you can explore. Or you can choose something from movie, novel, anything so and then in here, this is what I was talking about, also that exploratory data analysis. If you find some data, if you can showcase that you found some very interesting data somewhere lying around in the internet that you basically go and connect via an API and grab the data and then do some cool fun stuff, right? Exploratory Analysis, right? Use the analytical tools that we have learned, use the visualizations that you have learned to basically show what you can what insight you can derive from the data using a human driven analysis, not using a machine driven analysis, which is what machine learning will do. But here, if you just do your exploratory analysis, that should be fine, right? So basically, the goal is to explore and summarize the data, detailing any interesting finding and next steps. So this, this part is also some some groups do. So let's say, you know that, okay, you have, you do find a good data set. Let's say climate data set, right? Remember that one example that I gave you, the Jenna climate data, which is what I did, the multivariate forecasting and all of that. Right? So if, let's say. So as a student, if I find that data set right now, instead of going all the way deep into doing the forecasting, you can still use that data and basically look into the different trends, seasonality, monthly, yearly, quarterly seasonality. You can probably do separate correlation plot showing how temperature is related to dew point and vice versa. You can do those pair wise scatter plot. You can do you can find the correlation and COVID variance and covariance between the different data. You can find the normal distribution of each of these data set and try to comment on like which one of the data sets are kind of expected to be more well behaved when in future, you put it through regression type analysis, right? Or machine learning models, right? So you can do lot of these. But then, instead of abandoning the whole thing, you can actually put as a next step. Oh, by the way, if we had more time or in future, in phase two, or season two, we propose to do so and so kind of thing using this data set. That's what some groups do. And then when comes project two, they basically start where they left in project one, and then they go on do full on regression classification or time series, depending on which type of data and what they want to do, right? So that does not again. That does not mean you have to have that continuation, but I'm saying some groups do. Now here, when I talk to some of the all of you guys, I thought that some of the groups are basically started to double with data that can actually be used as a continuation in the project too. But for some other groups, their topic may not be extensible to project two. Both are fine, right? I'm just throwing some ideas there. If you want one, you could do that because that's what some students groups do, and there is no right or wrong thing. And this is, this is like, there would be no additional credit or anything, any average in grading if you choose one data set and continue through that project to a project. No, but sometimes that probably makes your life simpler, because you have, if you have already done a lot of research, done a lot of digging in and brainstorming for the first project, you can say, Okay, we already have a very, very good data set, and we can do lot of machine learning with this in the coming weeks. So maybe we will keep that aside, and then we'll come back at it later. So yeah, but yeah. So then, basically, the point is you are doing exploratory analysis. And again, while doing exploratory analysis, after you do the exploration phase, since, especially since you have one extra day, if some of you guys feel like, Oh, okay. Benoit did show us all of these time series forecasting and now we do have some time. Let's go and go ahead and do some time series forecasting events anyway. That is totally fine by me as well. Okay, so whatever you guys are comfortable doing, yeah, and then there is basically just couple of examples. I don't want to run through this example. One is aggregation of crime data from different police station and basically find the crime pattern based on maybe different demographical or socio economic data. That's one Uber rides and weather, if you find that kind of data. But frankly speaking, all the five ideas that you guys have, I think, are probably better than these two ideas. So you don't suggest take these two, not as a not as a definitive guide or anything. This is just like, you know, like these are something you might want to treat think of, but this is just an example. So you guys all have found ideas, mostly, so if you can stick to those ideas, that's fine. So what we'll do today is, today, after you break out into your room, I'll give you maybe 510 minutes to settle down, and then we'll start visiting your rooms. And I would like to see for all of you guys, at least by the time, maybe by break time, if possible, to see the project idea written in your README file in your GitHub repository, right? And then second half of the class. I am not going to interrupt you at all. I will stay in the main room, and then you guys can come back out if you have any question. Otherwise, I'll leave you on your own completely towards the second half. Okay, any questions

Unknown Speaker  9:27  
before we break out

Unknown Speaker  9:35  
so we're allowed to use more than one data set?

Speaker 2  9:36  
Yeah, of course. Thank you. You

Speaker 1  9:45  
How does the breakout room look like? Karen, oh, is it same as last time? One through eight I

Speaker 3  9:51  
made a because I read the news, but okay, maybe

Unknown Speaker  9:55  
we can just do five from next time.

Speaker 3  10:00  
Yes aid so they get amused and doesn't cost okay, they sang, okay.

Speaker 1  10:07  
Well, by the time you know, you guys know which group number you are. Some of you guys have fancy group names, but you know numerically which group we are calling you from the beginning, like there is no particular reason in that numbering, but whatever numbers start from the first day we found the group, okay? So choose your group, breakout rooms for your respective group, and join there, and we'll start visiting you after maybe about 10 minutes or

Speaker 3  10:32  
so, and the extra three, if someone like has a question they need one on one so they can we can go. So that's the idea. Yep, yep.
