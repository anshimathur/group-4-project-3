Speaker 1  0:03  
Perfect. Thank you so much, and we'll go ahead and get started. So Hello everyone. Welcome. Welcome to your very first day of the AI bootcamp. We are so excited to have you here. I'm going to go through some introductions, and then I'm going to go through some logistics and some tips for success. And then we'll have some time for questions, if you have any of that. And then after that, we'll hop into your very first lesson. So we'll go ahead and get started with introductions. So first off, my name is Sean Briar Olin. My pronouns are they them, and I am your Student Success advisor. I will be here to support you through the ups and downs, and, you know, rewarding, rewards and challenges of this really intense learning experience, you may find that you need a little extra help here or there, here or there, and I should be your first point of contact when it comes to that. If you need anything like a review of the academic resources, if you need you know links to career services, things like that. I can help you out a little bit about me. I am actually a boot camp grad myself. I took a full stack web development boot camp back in 2018 many moons ago, but I so I understand exactly what you're going through. I know what it's like to have those late nights and to not speak to my friends or family for months on end because I'm way too busy with my nose and a computer screen. So if you ever just want to just talk about the experience of someone who understands, I'm here for you as well. But yeah, so that's me. Sean Briar Olin, your Student Success advisor, hopefully you've received a few emails for me, if not check your inbox. I would love to chat with each of you one on one in the coming weeks, just so we can get to know each other. I can hear about your educational goals. We can talk about, you know, the success, the support options we have available to you, and which one would work best for your learning style. I'm totally here for that. So later on, you'll see my calendar link. I will put it in the Zoom chat, and I would love for you to book some time just to chat with me and say, Hey, I'm gonna pass the mic over to your instructor, Benoit to introduce himself.

Speaker 2  2:13  
Thank you, Sean. Hey, hello everyone. My name is Benoy, just making sure my audio is clear to everyone. Cool. Okay, cool. So I am very excited to get started with all of you guys, and I think this is probably going to be the largest cohort that I have ever taught. So it's great to see all the energy, all the activity that I see on the Slack channel, right? So a little bit about myself. I basically started teaching boot camp with to you edX about two, three years back. Now I have done three other boot camps before. I usually do teach FinTech, and this is my you guys and my first cohort on AI. So a little bit of background about myself. So I have been working in the in the tech industry in various areas, starting from your enterprise computing, cloud computing, AI and machine learning and so on, for about over 20 years now. I have prior work experience working with Amazon AWS, within their machine learning team, and I have been very actively engaged in their machine learning technical field community inside Amazon, so I have helped a lot of companies and partners, customers and partners, to basically build cloud based machine learning services and workloads using AWS cloud. I know a little bit about other clouds as well, but when it comes to using the online platform to run your machine learning workloads, basically, AWS is my go to platform, not that we are going to go through that in this class, because here what we will be doing is, mostly we'll be using our own computer. I think someone asked that question in one of the slack channel I saw. So just wanted to make sure that you do not need to have any cloud platform. So we'll be walking through you. We'll be taking you through an exciting journey. We will start a little bit slow, but then things will rapidly pick up, as you will see. So yeah, so I just can't wait to get started.

Speaker 1  4:21  
Awesome. Thank you so much. I'll pass the mic over. I want to say key in I have a cousin named she, and that's spelled just like that with an S, but I think it's key in your teaching. I haven't heard it, right. Okay, great.

Speaker 3  4:34  
All right. Hello, everybody. My name is Kian. I graduated with a degree in data analytics from Washington State University, and then I immediately jumped over here to to you to start teaching data analytics and data science courses. This is gonna be my third cohort now, and I'm really excited to meet you all, and I'm glad to be a part of your

Unknown Speaker  4:54  
journey. Awesome. Thank you. And Karen, you.

Speaker 4  5:00  
Yeah, and yeah, be one of the teaching assistants. A lot of different experience and software development and stuff over a long period of time, kind of intermittently, though, but now a lot of my focus has been on machine learning and AI. So this is going to be really fun,

Unknown Speaker  5:21  
awesome. Thank you, Karen and Mohammed.

Speaker 5  5:23  
Hey, hello, everybody. My name is Mohammed, and I'm a data scientist. I work for a company called doter. I have been with you for around two years and a half, and this is my fourth cohort. I have been TA for data before that. And I wish to I wish a great quote like, I wish you the best. And whenever you have any problem, especially with Mac, I can hopefully help you with that. Even windows,

Speaker 1  5:55  
perfect. Yeah, thank you so much. So that is your instructional team. As you heard, these folks are super knowledgeable on the topics they will be presenting to you in class, and not only that, but also in boot camp life, right? Many of them have experience working and teaching in these environments. It's going to it's a really unique educational environment, as I said before, so having these folks on your side is going to be definitely a plus for you. Please lean on your instructional staff for support. They are going to be there every step of the day, every step of the way, helping you through, helping you through the process. So yeah, so that's your support team. I wanted to talk a little bit about the boot camp partnership. So as you know, this is a a consortium class, meaning that we have folks from different university partnerships and institutions all in one class. It's really cool, because you get to collaborate, work with each other, and hear different perspectives from different areas. Hear about, you know, how the industry is in that specific region. So just, you know, FYI, we all know that. But I wanted to talk a little bit about the boot camp partnership. So your respective institution, they are the folks who they vet all of our curriculum, as well as our instructional staff, and they you will receive your recipient, your certificate from those from your respective institutions. So if you signed up, you know, with a or a, ASU or U, of U, you know, it will have that University's respective logo and name on your certificate. That's the university side of the partnership over here at edX, what we do is we handle the enrollment of the students. We also provide student and faculty support and communication, like I work for edX, and we have a really wonderful career support team, and we basically write the curriculum and hire the instructional staff to be vetted by our university partnerships. So that's kind of how they're different. So that's why, like, my email is from bootcamp spot.com my signature says edX, because I work for edX. Yeah. All right, so I want to shift gears a little bit and talk about support and how we can help you. There are so many avenues of support that you can take, and it can be a little overwhelming, so I just want to outline each of them. Now think about, you know, the way that your learning style works, what has worked for you in the past, and pinpoint one of these, are many, or all of these support resources that you think would work best for you, and lean on that one. If that one maybe doesn't work out, you can try another one, or you can use all four, which is what I would always recommend as your Student Success Manager, advisor. So anyway, so first off, let's talk about your support team. I am your Student Success advisor. So that is me. I will be, you know, handling any if you have, if you don't know who to ask, you ask me, essentially, if you have issues with, you know, needing to maybe transfer out of class, or you have a grievance that comes up, you come chat with me about it. I'm also really good about, you know, hearing feedback about the class, navigating any concerns that you may have, or we can talk about time management and success planning. We can do a catch up plan if you fall a little behind. We can also work on, you know, setting a schedule for yourself and some success tips. That's me. Your instructional team is a good point of contact to reach out if you need academic support or tech help. I am not an AI professional, so if you come to me with a homework question, unfortunately I will not be able to answer but I can't point you in the right direction of who to ask. And a lot of times, that's your instructional team. We also have a central support team as well, and they handle a lot of technical issues. There is a support ticket that you could submit if you have questions about technical errors or anything like that. And in addition to essential support, we have a career services team as well. So that's kind of like the support team and how they're divided when it comes to resources. We have four main avenues of academic support that you can go down. So the first one that I want to highlight here is called expert. It's our very own AI that we have developed, and we've loaded it full of the AI curriculum and common questions that students ask about the homework. So if you have any questions and say it's like 3am because you're just burning that Midnight Oil, you should definitely sleep. But sometimes it happens that you're up at 3am and you're working on your homework, you can always reach out to expert. Or maybe it's early in the morning, like before work or something, or you just want a quick, succinct answer instantly. Expert is a great place to go. You can find expert. It's called expert learning assistant, and it's in the left hand side of your boot camp spot side menu. There's a left menu, and it's over there a little bit towards the bottom. It's called expert learning assistant. Next we have ask BCS. So ask BCS is our connection to a live chat feature to our learning assistants. These are real folks there. It's not an AI, and they basically live and breathe to answer your homework questions, and you can contact them via the slack workspace. So if you haven't joined slack yet, I did send an email out on Friday, but if not, I'm going to drop that link here in the Zoom chat. Here we go. There we go. So if you haven't joined the slack workspace, please do right now, Slack workspace is going to be very important to connecting with instructional staff, with getting announcements for me, and connecting with the rest of your peers, but also that's how you access ask VCs, which is this really cool live chat feature with folks who can help answer your homework questions right into the slack workspace. Another option we have is office hours. So before and after each class, your instructional staff will be available to you to answer questions about homework, module, content, whatever it may be, and it's that starts 45 minutes before class, and it goes until half an hour after class, and that's every single class. We didn't have a before office hours today, because it's the first day, but we definitely will have an after office hours tonight, after the course, after your first lesson is over, office hours is a really good way to get to know your instructional staff, and kind of, like a more leisurely environment. It's not, you know, there's no lesson plan to go through, and you can just kind of have, like conversations about the content. Also you get to hear the kinds of questions that your peers are asking, and it's very likely that you have the same question, or you've just recently solved that problem, and you can help answer that question for a peer. Remember that you're all doing the same work at the same time, and you're all learning this for the first time together as well. So you're going to have the same questions come up, right? So please do lean on your instructional staff. Lean on each other for support as well, and remember that you don't have to go through this process alone. The final one we have is tutoring. So we have a whole team of tutors that are available to that you can book one on one time with. It's in a zoom session. It's 50 minutes five oh, 50 minutes of one on one, support through homework or module challenges, reviewing activities, whatever you want to do in that tutoring session. You You know that's your time. You can book a tutor by going to the tutor Sessions tab and boot camp spot that's also on that left hand side menu, you get 25 sessions for the entirety of the six month program. That's my dog click clacking. Don't know if you can hear him, but he's got really long nails on the vinyl floor. So sorry, but you can you have 25 sessions to book for the entire six month period. There's 24 weeks and six months. So we highly recommend that you do a session a week so that you can take full advantage of that tutoring

Speaker 1  13:51  
resource through the entirety of the six months. I mean, there it's your bucket of sessions. You can use it however you like, but we do recommend one session a week, and that way you'll have tutoring the whole time. You only get 25 sessions. So those are the four main resources. If you have any questions about those, please feel free to reach out to me or your instructional staff who are also very knowledgeable on these resources. Again, I did put my email address in the slack chat. You'll all or the zoom, excuse me, the Zoom chat. I'll also put it in Slack as well, but hopefully, as I said, you've already received an email from me, so I'm already in your inbox. All right. I also wanted to reiterate, I know that you probably saw this in an email, but we have a resource guide that goes through all of the resources I just did in boot camp spot. It's the boot camp orientation, please read that's the email that that that you got, kind of outlining what this resource guide is, but it's Module Zero in Canvas, so please do take a look at that resource guide if you didn't have time to do the pre work, which you you know probably should still do, if you can find the time. Time, or, you know, you're just now logging in the resource guide is going to be really, really helpful for you. So if anything, at least review this resource guide. And like I said, if you have any questions, I'm here to help answer them. And that's Module Zero in Canvas, all right, course requirements. So also on the left hand side menu of boot camp spot is a tab called syllabus. Hopefully you've reviewed that syllabus by now, but if you I believe it's on tab, I think it's 14 or 15, maybe 12, somewhere in the early teens, talks about your course requirements, everything that you need to check off in order to receive that certificate. At the end of this six month period, we have attendance expectations, homework expectations, project completion expectations, and as well as tuition requirements. So you know, you do need to be paying your bill. You do need to attend class. You do need to do the homework, if you choose, if you plan on receiving that certificate and earning that shiny piece of paper that's actually digitally sent to you, but we can talk about that in about six months anyway, please do review your syllabus so that you have a full idea of what we expect from you by the last day of class, so that you can earn that certificate. Also reminder that each of you signed an enrollment agreement, and within that enrollment agreement, it does also talk about the requirements. There is a drop period. So if you are reviewing the syllabus and those course requirements, you're reviewing the enrollment agreement that you signed, and you're thinking, oh goodness, I'm not sure I can meet all of these requirements right now. Or you're like, wait a minute, this isn't underwater basket weaving. I'm in the wrong class. Please let me know you have until Monday, so a week from today, to decide if you want to drop or transfer from this class. After that you were unable to drop or transfer without a much more complicated process and like a life circumstance. So if you do feel that this is not the right class for you or not the right time. Please let me know before the next, before Monday this coming Monday, a week from today. Okay, I want to talk a little bit about what we expect from you as students in this class. I know I've said it before. This is a really unique learning environment. It's going to be very intense, and it's going to be very challenging, but it's okay, because that's what you signed up for, right? You signed up for something that's going to challenge you, that you're going to learn from. You're going to learn these really cool skills with a bunch of really cool people, and then at the end, you're going to have this really cool certificate that you can show. Look, I learned this. I did this hard thing, and I did it really well, but in order to do that, you do need to have some expectations in your mind and some things that we highly recommend that you prioritize in order to be successful in this class. The first two are quite common, Scentsy, right? Be on time. We're going to hit the ground running at 630 every single day. If you're late to class, you're going to miss a lot and because of the, how can I say accelerated nature of this course, and also how dense the material is, if you miss a couple minutes, it's it's going to be like you're missing a lot. If you miss a day, it's going to be like missing an entire week. So keep that in mind. Also be honest and respectful. You know, we've got a team of folks that grade your homework and they do check for plays or plagiarism, so keep that in mind. And also, you know, we are in a classroom full of folks from all different areas, all different backgrounds, all different, you know, lived experiences. So it's really, really important that everybody comes to class feeling welcome and that they can be their authentic selves and that they can be relaxed enough to learn in this environment. So number one human rule, right? Be kind, be respectful and be nice to each other. Dramatic Pause. Be kind, be respectful, be nice to each other. We're all here to learn, so just focus on that. Also, it's important to submit projects and assignments on time. As I said, we have a team of folks who grade your homework, and it's so much easier for them to stay on a good cadence if you're turning in your assignments on time. Also, you have a homework assignment due just about every single week. If you get behind on that, the rest of the class, you know, isn't going to pause that to wait for you to get caught up. So things can really snowball quickly. So you're really going to want to make sure that you're turning in assignments on time, because if you get a little bit behind, that turns into a lot of bit behind pretty quickly. If you do fall behind. Don't worry. It definitely happens. Life happens. We have things outside of our control that may, you know, be road blockers for us in this class, that's okay. Come hang out with me. I can talk about a catch up plan. I can help ease some of your stressors on that, and talk about, you know, homework tips and things like that. That's exactly what I'm here for. So it's okay. If you get behind, just know that. You know we can help you get caught up.

Speaker 1  20:05  
So respond to the weekly survey. Every single week, we will ask, Hey, how's it going? How can we help? And that mainly pertains to the week before. So we're gonna, we're gonna, we want to know how you know how things are going with the content, how things are going with our you know, instruction and your support. And if there's anything we can do to make your experience better, we can pivot pretty quickly in these courses. So you know, if there's any suggestions that you have or anything that we can do to, you know, support, you please let us know in those weekly surveys, we check them. They are anonymous, but we check them, we check the numbers, we check the comments, and we read them every single week, and we like to hear what you what we all are thinking about the course, especially if you have something good to say. We love that. So stay focused and pay attention. This class is very, very fast. I've said it before. I'll say it a bazillion times again. You look away one second. You come back, you can be totally lost. So it might be a good idea to keep your phone on silent, make sure that you're in a quiet place where you can focus remove distractions around you. That can be really helpful. However you learn, if you found that there's a way for you to learn in the past, capitalize on that and use that in this process. I'm a fidgeter. I'm a total fidgeter. So I usually have like, little toys like on my desk that I can fidget with while I'm trying to focus that really helps me. I'm sure you have something that you found that really helps you focus. So keep that in mind and definitely use it for for this course. Second to last, we we recommend that you spend at least 20 hours a week practicing outside of class. And we say practicing, we need watch the class session recordings, redo the class session activities, do your homework, redo the module content. You know, all these things that we can do to help review the materials that you've that you've been exposed to during the lecture can be really helpful. It's going to go by really, really quick the lectures, and sometimes it can be in one ear and out the other, right? And the way that humans learn things is by repetition. So reviewing class session recordings, doing the activities again, going over your homework again, meeting with a study group to talk about the content, all that kind of stuff can be really helpful for your learning process, and that takes time, and we recommend at least 20 hours of week outside of 20 hours per week outside of class. So that means so let's see this class is about 12 to 13 hours a week plus 20. So that's 23 if you're working a 40 hour work week, then that's, you know, already, a big chunk of your week out. So it may mean that you're not going to have as many social, you know, events coming up, or you're going to have to say no to some obligations that you may have in order to focus on this class. I will say that being in that, being in that situation previously, the way that I handled that that really helped was I set the expectation with my friends and family that I was going to be doing this class, and I probably wouldn't be as as available as I was before. Of course, you know, there's like, important life events, like weddings and things like that, that you have to go to. But you know, you know, skipping Sunday brunch every once in a while is probably going to be in your in your best interest, and just saying, like, Hey, I'm doing this really awesome thing. I need to focus on it. So I'll see you in a couple months. That might be something that you want to consider doing. Because really, we found that the students who do put in that extra time outside of class are the ones who are most successful. And then finally ask for help when you need it. You know, you've met your instructional staff, you've you've heard me talk now here for 20 minutes, 30 minutes, so you know that there are folks available that are here to help, and we don't want you to, quote, suffer in silence. Of course, hopefully you're not suffering at all during this class, maybe just a little bit, because that's how you're like, challenged and learned. But anyway, we don't want you to suffer in silence. Let us know if you have concerns or something's going on in your life, that we can you know we can help support, help you navigate that in tandem with this class. Yeah, yeah. So that is what we expect. Again, you did sign an enrollment agreement. Within that enrollment agreement is the code of conduct that basically talks about, if you are not honest and respectful that there will be repercussions for that. That was a lot and a little bit of time, but it's kind of a precursor as to what you will be experiencing for the next six months. So I hope I didn't scare you away too much, but I'm going to go ahead and stop my share here and see we can do about five minutes of questions, and if you have them, if not, I can kick it right over to Benoit to start your first lesson. Does anybody have any questions for me? Feel free to use the raise the hand function or just come off mute. Yeah.

Speaker 6  25:01  
Okay, so many things to ask.

Unknown Speaker  25:05  
Oh, I see Jesse, hi. How can I help you? I'm

Speaker 7  25:07  
just wondering for group projects, how will the groups be selected? Will it be self selected or selected by the TA teachers name?

Speaker 1  25:16  
That's a great question. I usually leave that up to the instructional staff. So Benoit, do you want to you want to get that one?

Speaker 2  25:24  
Yes. So for the group projects, I mean, it's kind of, there is no formal structure to it. So in my prior classes, sometimes students, like, reach me out. They ping me, like, hey, I want to work with so and so people. And I'm saying, like, Yeah, that's fine. So that is fine. Sometimes what happens is there is kind of a bias, and sometimes what that happens is people who might not have a strong technical background, and they kind of tend to fall behind, and that's when we instructional team try to make sure that the groups are somewhat balanced, right? So, but then I mean this, we are pretty flexible on it. As we go through the first few classes, the instructional team, me and all our TAs will have a pretty good idea what is your strength and weaknesses, and we'll make sure that the teams are balanced. So when it comes to that, we will, we will notify you, like, if you have any personal preference, let us know, if not, based on what we see, we will try to balance the group as equitably as possible.

Unknown Speaker  26:29  
Awesome, perfect. Thank you. Vinoy,

Speaker 8  26:34  
I have a good question. Sure. Hi. Ingrid, hi. So during the class, I know it's a three hours class, will there be any break time? Like maybe every hour, we have a five minutes break.

Speaker 2  26:45  
Yeah, we will have a 15 minute break between each class. So, yeah, okay, thanks. Like, somewhere around the mid of the class Mark, I mean, but that might change depending on how the discussion flow is going, but somewhere around the middle of that, will have about 15 minutes back every day. I have a question. Yeah, go ahead, Matt,

Speaker 3  27:09  
you had talked about there being a live chat feature in the slack. Where is that? Yeah,

Speaker 1  27:16  
yeah, great question. So if you go up to if you're in the slack workspace at the very top, whether, whether you're in desktop, desktop app or the browser, the very top there will be a search bar. Go ahead and click into that search bar and type in ask BCS, and you'll see pop up the Ask BCS. I'm doing it right now as I'm that's why I'm looking at mine the Ask BCS app. And if you click that, that will activate the that will open the app on in your slack. And it actually will create a category in your menu here, under Apps, and that will lead you to the ask the question button. And then you can continue on from there, but just search ask BCS in your slap slack workspace, and it'll be an app that you can use. Yeah, cool, cool. Okay, great, awesome. Well, thank you all so much for hanging out with me tonight. You'll see me. You will be interacting hopefully a lot in the next six months. I will not be in class every single night, but I will be popping in here and there to say, hey, please feel free to reach out if you have questions or concerns, or just to chat for that initial one on one, I'd love to see you again. There's my contact information in the Zoom chat. I'm also going to put in the slack workspace, but I will pass the mic over to Benoit and say goodnight to you. All. Have a wonderful first lesson, and I hope I hear from you soon. Thank you so much.

Unknown Speaker  28:44  
Bye. Thank you, Sean, okay,

Speaker 2  28:54  
cool, hey. Okay, so that was a nice introduction, and I think that lot of you have probably a lot of question like, I think I heard, Daniel, you mentioned there's so many questions to ask. Feel free to ask some of those in the Slack channels me and the Ts, we are going to try to answer the best as we could. Also it might so happen that as you go along, as we go along, the class, some of those will be answered. So feel free to ask any time offline or during the like when we do the Q, amp, a after the after the lecture, right? So cool. So let's get started. What I'm going to do, since there are a lot of you, I am not going to do a personal introduction, because then we'll spend the whole time doing the personal introduction, but it is also kind of important for me to understand what kind of background do you have. And what I'll try to do is, as we interact more and more, as we go along the course, I'll try to try to get and know you better who you are, what your strengths are, right? Okay, you know more of you as a person, right? So typically, what happens is, even after the boot camp case gets over, my learners always remain connected with me via LinkedIn. Sometimes if there is a job opportunity that I ping them, or if they want something taping me right on LinkedIn. So we basically start to form a community, right? So today is the first day, but I think the next six months, we'll have a great ride together, all of us, right? So before we get into the content, since we cannot do because we have, this is a large class, we cannot do personal intro right at the beginning. But if I would ask you to share just a few things, and what I'm going to do is I'm going to ask you, and then you can either do a plus one or something on the Zoom channel, and I'd like some of our TAs maybe Mohammed. You can take a note, this is just to understand the technical background of people, nothing else, right? I'm not going to ask what educational qualification you have that that's not my concern, but I'm just trying to understand how much technical background you have, so that I can, when I deliver my course, I can basically pay attention to what people already know and what are the things that I need to focus more on. Okay, so my first question is and give a plus one or thumbs up. If you have done any kind of programming before

Unknown Speaker  31:29  
and Mohammed, please take a note.

Unknown Speaker  31:38  
Okay, lot of plus ones. Very good.

Speaker 2  31:45  
Oh, I get a plus point five. That's funny. Okay, so, Daniel, you have no programming background, okay? Tiffany, you don't either Sims, Jose, you neither. Punish point, two, five, okay, 09, okay, okay, okay. So overall, I am seeing about 6040, split. I'd say little more than half of you have done some kind of programming.

Unknown Speaker  32:32  
Thank you. Like the numbers, maybe around 20. That's

Speaker 2  32:35  
about that, right? Okay. Now, next question would be, give me a thumbs up if you have done Python programming specifically Python, because that is the language we are going to use. That is not a prerequisite, by the way, because we are going to show you how to start coding in Python from ground up. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  33:03  
if you want, we could just make a poll here.

Speaker 2  33:07  
Oh, we could do that, yeah. Why didn't I think about it before? So, yeah, that's fine, yeah. I mean, we could have done that, Karen, but I think I have gotten a pretty good idea of what I wanted to do. So it looks like looks like in a Python. It's about 5050.

Unknown Speaker  33:27  
Is that what it looks like? Mohammed,

Speaker 5  33:28  
yeah, I think, yeah. From 50, like around 13 of the 22 or the 23

Speaker 2  33:35  
some kind of Python, okay, oh, some people have done c plus, plus basic. Pascal. Okay, sounds good, okay. And then last question, give me a plus one. If any of you have done anything remotely related to machine learning, either training a model or doing some kind of generative AI stuff, or anything remotely related.

Unknown Speaker  34:05  
Okay, so I got one two.

Unknown Speaker  34:09  
This is going fast.

Speaker 2  34:20  
Okay? I think the half as well, yeah, yeah, of course. I mean, that is, that is why you guys are here, right? That's what I was expecting to see. Okay, so I see some folks have done before. I'd say those who have done some form of machine learning before, please engage with your peers. Engage with me and the TAs, as we discussed, right? So no need to be shy or no need to kind of hide, what you already know, because we are welcoming people from all sorts of different backgrounds here, like I have done, I have run courses before, where people who have who are basically current computer science students to all the way, like people who are basically. Nurses or some kind of healthcare workers, some people who are in, let's say, real estate business and all. There are many, many different kind of people who are looking to understand and learn data science and AI and machine learning and fintech and so on. So please, please feel free to engage with your community. For those of you who have done some of these things before, also you will probably see, contrary to what kind of Sean mentioned, that this is going to be a very fast paced class. Yes, it is, but just a word of caution, especially for those people who have done some kind of programming, specifically Python programming, or machine learning. You have done some form of machine learning, you might see first few weeks is probably kind of a slow build up, but that's because we basically have to bring everyone up to the speed so that everyone can meaningfully contribute and learn from these boot camp right? So so first few weeks might seem not that past best for some of you who have some background, but please bear with us and during those weeks, try to help others with your experience, that amazing experience that some of you already bring into the class. Okay, cool. So with that being said, let's get started with today's session. Just hang on, give me a moment while I share my screen.

Unknown Speaker  36:37  
Okay, do you see the slides.

Speaker 2  36:44  
Cool. Okay, so welcome to the first class of this week. So one thing I'd like to say about all the classes for this week, the three, three classes that we have right today, tomorrow and Thursday. So you will see the way that the classes have been formatted is, we'll spend first half of the class understanding conceptually what AI is, what are the different applications of AI, and what AI is not right, so trying to understand the conceptual, having a conceptual understanding about artificial intelligence and machine learning, and then in the second half of the class, and there will be a 15 minutes break in between, and in the second half of the class will basically try to get our get ourselves more competitive, comfortable with the different tools that we are going to eventually use To create machine learning models and do all other activities, right? Do our starting our Python programming and so on. But in this week itself, we are specifically not going to get into actually doing any AI or ml programming yet, because we are going to be using the second part of the class to basically understand, hey, how do we install the different prerequisites? How do we configure? How do we use them, making sure that we can use the command line tools. We can use the GitHub, we can use the Anaconda and so on and so forth, right? So that's the general format of the classes for this first week. Cool. So before we jump in, into what AI is, one thing I'd like to mention, and which is something Sean also touched upon in her presentation as well, that all of you who are in this class need to have a growth mindset, right? So meaning you need to believe in yourself that you are not limited by the skills and abilities that you already postposed Now based on your previous education experience and so on. But you should have that belief in yourself that what you are going to learn may be completely different than what you have learned so far, the skills that you have acquired so far, right? Because everyone here, we are adult learners, right? So we all have our strength areas. We have we are in different jobs, but we are here to challenge ourselves to grow beyond that, right? So it is very, very, very important for all of you guys to have growth mindset, right? And when you, when you do that, right? So who, who like? Who? Who does have growth mindset, right? It's the babies, the kids, the toddlers. Because when, when you are a kid, right? You don't know much about the world, but you always look towards the world with the curiosity, right? So anything that happens around you is new to you, right? So you will see that kind of moment. Sometimes you will not, sometimes, actually at many, many times, specifically ones who have not done any kind of a technical, deep dive into any sorts of programming and stuff like that, before you will see that, just like a toddler, not like like a toddler, you will probably be basically coming across different toys. Sometimes the toys are too easy. So you can look, take a pick up a toy in your hand, and you can figure out, oh, there is a button I press here and it makes it makes a sound good. It sometimes the toys are a little bit more complex to understand, product to understand, but you need to have that kind of a mindset, to explore with curiosity, to the to all the things that kind of starts appearing around you in your world, right? So you need to be ready to basically challenge yourself and doubt yourself. And don't be afraid that if you are confused at any point of time, because all of these are part of learning. Right, doubt, challenge, confusion. These are not necessarily your weaknesses, right? Whenever you see a challenge which seems like a failure, you need to kind of rephrase that in your mind and say, no, it's actually an opportunity for me to learn something new, right? So, so, so relish these, these novice experience, right? And the light of light bulb moments, which, which I'm sure will come. It always, always comes. You probably will, and it does. It's not that it will come right away, right? So the way that our learning process works, that we may be trying, we may be slogging hard for days or sometimes even weeks on end, and nothing seems to click right. And then suddenly that light bulb moment happens, maybe something your peer says, maybe something I say, or some of the TA or your tutor says, and suddenly you can connect all these dots right. And suddenly everything falls into place. So look forward. Keep an eye open. Keep your eyes and ears open when you are struggling, right? So do not just, as Sean said, do not suffer in silence. Reach out to us and use those tutoring session and these light bulb moments will suddenly certainly hit you. So talking about this growth mindset, I just want you to watch. This is a TED Talk video by Carol Dweck, who basically Anish, first coined this term growth mindset. But I just want you to watch just a couple of minutes within this video, and I think we have enough time. So I don't know whether the audio will flow through, though, but let me start the video and let me know whether you can hear the audio. If you cannot, then Kian is going to make this slide deck available to you, or I can even post the link to this TED talk so that you can listen to it later. But let's see.

Unknown Speaker  42:19  
Sorry, I'm pausing now, are you hearing the sound?

Speaker 2  42:23  
It is not you are not hearing the sound. Okay, so let's not worry about it. That's why I was not sure when I present this on Zoom, whether the audience on the other side will be able to hear the sound. But I am going to send the link on the Slack channel in the ask the class channel and you can watch it later. Okay, so basically, what the she's saying is, when a student is failing to learn something, we don't call that as a failure. We basically called it, you are not there yet, right? It's not it does not mean that you cannot or you are a failure. Is just that you are not there yet. And that's what this talk about in the TED talk that you presented the power of the word yet. So watch it later in your own time. It's a wonderful talk. Oops, yeah, okay, so I'll send that link later. Okay, cool. And then, as I said, form a community with your classes or classmates already, because this is the one thing, it's which is great about any boot camp or any university education for that matter, right? Because what happens when we are in school, right? Typically, we are surrounded by people or students or peers who are kind of at our same age group, kind of everyone knows kind of the same thing, but when you come to a larger boot camp platform such as these, you are opening yourself up for a much more diverse experience, right? You are coming across people who are either data scientists, some of them are probably data scientists, right currently, or some of them are probably aspiring to be, maybe a programmer or data scientist or FinTech professional, or some of them who have a completely different background and therefore come with a very different mindset, right, very different insight about how things work than you are. So try to use this to your leverage from the community, and which I'm sure you will more especially I have seen towards the end of the boot camp, especially after the first group project happens. The students who are grouped together, like for these 456, people, they seem to be kind of forming a very closely need family, right? And I have seen healthy competition between these groups, right? Trying to out compete each other, right? So it's all part of fun, all part of London, right? So you guys will all go through that same experience. And then lastly, before jumping into the core topic of today, one thing which also Sean mentioned about 20 hours per week. Well, I don't want to put that hard number, because some people can probably get a lot of. Things Done, some people might need little bit more, because they might not be there yet, right? But one thing that is true, no matter what your background is, that there is no shortcut, right? Even those of you who think, Oh, I have done some machine learning before, or I have done some programming before, you will see when you face with some of the challenges, when you give you towards the towards the second half of the course, when we the when we challenge you to come up with a machine learning algorithm, right? To basically solve a problem, you will see that you have to put in the hours, right? You You may not always succeed at the first attempt, right? So, so be ready to to basically roll up your sleeves and put on all the hard work for the next six months as we go through this boot camp. Any question before we dive into the core of the class today?

Speaker 9  45:55  
Hi, yeah. Is this supposed to be six months or three months?

Speaker 2  46:01  
It's 24 weeks, so six months. Okay, yeah,

Speaker 2  46:11  
okay, so let's get into it. So we will talk about what artificial intelligence is, right? But before we try to define artificial intelligence, and I'm sure you guys probably have some idea what artificial intelligence is, but I want to adopt a slightly different approach. I want to first look into the history and point some of the prominent event that has happened over past 60, 7080, years, right? That kind of defined the field of artificial intelligence, right? You may not know what all these events are right at the beginning, but let's go through this, and as we come to the much more closer history you will see, then you will be probably able to better relate and connect to some of the events that you have heard in the internet or in the forum or in the blog post or in the YouTube around you, right? So let's just go through some of the, some of the more interesting thing that kind of shaped the industry over the last well, 1950 is my first event here. So what? 74 years? Yeah, it's been a long time. Okay, so in 1950 Alan Turing, right, who was a renowned computer scientist and mathematician at that time, artificial intelligence as we know it, didn't really exist, right? But thought leaders like Turing at that time, they start, try, started to kind of postulate that there would eventually be a time come coming where the machine would be able to pass the test of human intelligent decision making, right? So his first part, he was the first person who postulated that, which was a bold prediction at that point, right? Because there is essentially nothing right. But these are the people we call visionaries, right? So, so he basically proposed a test that the test goes like this, an interrogator, an impartial interrogator, without having any knowledge to the agent that he's talking to, has to figure out which, like basically communicates with the with with an entity, intelligent entity not knowing who is that there on the other side of the screen, and he has to figure out which answer belongs to a human and which belongs to a machine. And if the interrogator is not able to distinguish the answer produced between the person and the machine, then we will call that an artificial intelligence, which, if you think about it, common sense, right? But if you think about it at that time, and these are the time when computers used to be like a size of maybe large office building, like one single computer, where people used to go to this computing room holding a card this big, which is called punch card, right? Where they will put some zeros and ones in forms of forms of holes and not holes, and put these cards into big machine and submit their job and maybe come back the next day, if they are lucky, to get the answer to their the computing job that they have submitted. So it is around that time, but Turing kind of envision that there will be a time where an interrogator would not be able to distinguish between an answer given by a man and a machine, right? And that still, date is kind of thought of as a golden standard of what defines an artificial intelligence. Okay? This does not tell you what it is, but it at least defines what behavior it should. It should show. It should. It should. What do you say it should? Yeah, it should exhibit. So that's 1950 okay. Then about five years later, John McCarthy, who is kind of considered the father of artificial intelligence, he. Wrote a paper where the term artificial intelligence was officially used, and during that in that paper, he actually made a comment that it will definitely happen, but he had no idea how soon or how how far it will go. So he made a he made a statement that it will happen within next five to 5000 years. So essentially, that is, I don't know, but I know it's going to happen, right? But then the very next year at Dartmouth College, right? That same, same John McCarthy and four other gentlemen, they basically arranged for a research conference, which is considered the first conference on AI. And in that research conference, these group of researchers, they came up with a program called the logic theorist. And this program you'd be surprised to know is actually available today. So you can actually go on a GitHub and you can find the code repository for this program. So this program was designed to mimic problem solving skills of human, which served as a proof that machine could perform some tasks that are considered intelligent. Okay, so that is 19, 556, which is what 70 years almost 68 years. So that was the first artificial intelligence program. Right then, after a few years, the first Chad bot was meant, which was Eliza. The idea was that it was kind of a psychotherapeutic robot that gives some preferred response to the user, so that the user will feel that they are talking to someone who understand their problem, which is not really an AI. It basically could only answer some of the preferred question. But it was kind of a, kind of a first attempt to make something which remotely looks like a chat bot. And these days, thanks to Alexa and Google Home and Siri and all of that, we know that Chad board do exist, and they are very real, right? But it's kind of surprising to know that the first Chad board actually appeared in 1964 right? So almost what? 60 years back from now,

Unknown Speaker  52:17  
cool and then,

Speaker 2  52:21  
after five years Stanford, they developed the world's first mobile, intelligent robot, right, which you can kind of think of as a grand idea of today's self driving cars or or your smart drones or whatnot, right? I mean, this robot actually has some amazing capabilities like it, but actually perceive its surrounding, right? Infer implicit fact versus explicit facts. It can create plans. If you ask it to move from one place to another, it can actually look at the different objects, and it can actually create a path plan for more motion for itself, and follow that motion to go from point A to point B, right? It also had a television monitor right to basically communicate with the human. And it had this whisker like thing, which is basically nothing but sensor jutting out of its body, which it will detect like, Hey, I am close to something like an obstacle, so therefore I need to move around right? So it could do some pretty cool stuff, but it is nothing like some of the robots. Like, let's say they make a Boston Dynamics today, right? I'm sure you probably have seen some YouTube videos of those, like a robot dog running around, or like a robotic humanoid robot, like, basically taking a dish from a dish from Iraq and serving you, serving an apple on to you on the dish. These are some of the robots that today do. But these was kind of the you can think about the precursor of all of these robots that are kind of coming after the hub, right? But that was kind of the initial trough of excitement which eventually led to basically disenchantment, right? Which, which, if you think about the hype cycle, right? This happens in the life of any product, right? And that's why it has a name like Gartner calls it the hype cycle. So it was no different from for AI as well. So between 19 mid 70s to around late 80s, the initial kind of enthusiasm around artificial intelligence, kind of dive down. And the reason for that is not because AI was not possible, but the simple matter of fact is the hardware that we need to support that kind of computing was not there, right? Well, mathematical model, those are also kind of they still needed to improve, but the main problem there was the computing power that was needed, that was simply not there, right? So, so we call this AI winter, but then towards the end of the winter, when the spring change, Spring came, there is basically a 1v Very, very important discovery that happened by young la Coon and three other scientists, which is called the convolutional neural network, right? And these are the neural network. So neural networks were already invented before, right, even before the winter, but we couldn't really put them into use, because, as I said, the computing power that we needed to basically train a sizable neural network was simply not available, right? That was one thing. And then other thing was the plain, simple neural network. They kind of failed to live up to the expectation. And then this group of these three researcher came up something called convolutional neural network, and with this these, they were successfully able to show that these networks can be trained to recognize handwritten characters, right and apply to various other real world problems, such as your vision recognition, speech recognition and so on. And that's where the new like the recent upliftment of AI and all these booms started with the invention of convolutional neural network. Then after a few years, the another Chad bot called Alice was developed, and these basically used the so called convolutional neural network, which made it much, much more effective because Eliza the bot that we talked about earlier those that was basically simply following some simple logic, right? But Alice was the first Chad bot, which basically used natural language processing, and it could actually convert the with the humans by applying pattern matching rules that enable the to convert money. I mean, hold the conversation more naturally, right? So that was the that was the chat bot that came in in 1995 and then this is a, basically a moment that, that is, that will be kind of marked in the history of man versus machine fight, where IBM's Deep Blue and machine was able to beat the current chess champion, right, Gary Kasparov. Now, this left people wondering, what else could machine do, and what other ways they can they could outsmart humans, right? What other tasks they could do? Right?

Unknown Speaker  57:20  
Then between 2006 and 2012

Speaker 2  57:24  
some of the more recent development happens. For example, in 2006 a database called image net was formed, which basically a huge database of different images that people will then eventually use to train the different machine learning model for things like pattern recognition, visual object recognition and stuff like that. So that database was created, and it kept growing. Then in 2009 Andrew Inc published this paper called large scale deep on supervised learning using the graphics processors, right? So this is where we basically learn. Hey, we could use these GPUs not just to play the video games, but we can actually use those GPUs to more effectively train very large scale convolutional neural network, and that's what tended basically contributed to the immense power that we see in today's AI models, then in 2012 so when these ImageNet database was created, there were a lot of groups of researchers from all over the world. They basically tried to out compete each other in recognizing those images using the artificial intelligence program that they come up with. Right? Then, a breakthrough was achieved when Geoffrey Hinton, he introduced a particular CNN architecture that won the challenge and that triggered the explosion of deep learning research and implementation. Right? And has anyone heard of this gentleman, Geoffrey Hinton, recently? Anyone students? TS, one recently, yes, he was the one. He was among the group of researchers who actually won the Nobel Prize for Physics this year, right? Like, think about it. How amazing, even though, yeah, yeah, because in

Unknown Speaker  59:21  
that of course, he

Unknown Speaker  59:25  
la Coon and

Speaker 4  59:27  
Joshua Benji also won the Turing Award, which was essentially the Nobel Prize for

Speaker 2  59:32  
part computing, yes, that's true. That's true. But the thing that excites me, yeah, the thing that excites me that how noble committee actually recognizes formally, the significance, the deep significance that neural network have on the research of physics as well, right? Because when you do computational physics, right, you are not bound to just do the simulation. You can actually solve lot of. So called hard problems, right? Or NP, hard problems that are not that was not being able to solve classically using classical computers, you could now solve these, right? Using these AI algorithms, these machine learning algorithms, not even using quantum computers, just within the bounds of the classical silicon computers, right? And that's why I believe the novel committee's recognition basically led to Geoffrey Hinton's being awarded the Nobel Prize.

Speaker 4  1:00:26  
The other one that came up, I think, was, was chemistry or I forget, but was two researchers from DeepMind who created the AI for folding proteins, yeah,

Speaker 2  1:00:39  
yeah. So the application of AI, very, very true, right, right? So application of AI is everywhere, right? It's not just the business, right? And when We will, we'll talk about some of the application, and we will get into font discussion, but let's just go through these. Okay, so then, so we talked about 2012 right? So this is, are you to consider these CNN architects that Jeffrey Hinton came up with this kind of was something that moved the field of AI into kind of the adulthood. Because before that, it was like, no matter what Chad what you do, it was kind of more like child story, right? But with this CNN architecture, it finally started to move towards the maturity, right. And then between 2014 to today, sorry, in 2014 researcher in Google named young good fellow, he invent, invented something called generative adversarial networks, and this is a class of machine learning framework that are used to generate photos, transform images or create what we know today, called Deep fakes. Say like these are the class of AI machine learning algorithm that does not only learn from the data, but it can actually create new data based on the previous data that it knows about, right? And around the same time, Facebook developed the deep learning based facial recognition system called Deep face, which can identify human faces in digital images, right with with very, very high accuracy. And then 2006 it was kind of a rematch of the man versus machine, where the deep blue defeated the chess champion. So in 2016 the deep minds, AlphaGo machine, or AlphaGo computer program, defeated the champion in Go. So go, I don't know how many of you know, but go is considered the most difficult board game that have ever been invented, which is many, many orders of magnitude more complicated than chess, right? So even though Deep Blue did beat Kasparov in chess, beating a human in go was kind of eluding the researchers for a very, very long time. So if you think about it, it was 1996 right, when computer beat human in chess game. But in order to beat a human in Go, it took another 220 years, two whole decades, for the AI to reach to that point that it could actually beat a person, a human being, in the go, which is the most complex board game in the world, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:03:24  
And then in 2017

Speaker 2  1:03:27  
another cool thing happened, which is called the transformer mechanism, right? So earlier, one problem of all of these AI algorithm was that, like, Hey, if you give it some data that could be like people's face or any picture of nature or dog or cat or something, right you and then AI was like mature enough or sophisticated enough to be very accurately identify those right, or identify your handwriting, right? But one thing AI was not very good at is memorizing what you have learned in the past, right? And why that is important. So let's say, if you are trying to create an AI that will be able to translate from one language, like I'm speaking in English, if I want an AI to translate in German or French or Spanish in real, near real time, that is something that was not possible because all of these algorithm up until at that point, it didn't know. It couldn't figure out what are the things that it has seen in the past and which of those learning it should give and which one of those learning it should forget. So it was trying to either forget everything or keep everything, and it was a total mess. And that's why it things like where your sequential learning is needed, such as your language translation, right, those things were kind of being held back, right. And 2017 these new kind of transformer mechanism was put forward in this paper, which is named, attention is. All you need, by a group of researchers from Google. And that basically created another kind of, I'd say, watershed moment in the development of new modern AI, right? And this is at the same time Stephen Hawking basically issued in a warning like, hey, unless we learn how to prepare and avoid potential risk. AI could be the worst event in the history of our civilization. Now my question is, how much weightage does Stephen Hawking's prediction hold today? Stephen Hawking was a great physicist, right, no doubt about that. But when he talks about the potential risk, and basically, kind of the worst event in the civilization that our future could be doomed. Are we really there yet, right? And we will discuss those rules. We'll see how people feel. But hey, when Alan Turing developed his test of what artificial intelligence should be, right? 7080 years back, no one could even think that we will come this far. So maybe another 78 years and that century or two, maybe we need to pay attention of to what Stephen Hawking said, but at least not right now, right? So we are nowhere close to that. So, and then finally, some of the very, very recent event, and this is what I was referring to you earlier. So you guys probably have heard a lot of these in social media, blog, YouTube and whatnot, which is in 2018 open AI, the company, released GPT, which is kind of like a household name right now, everyone does GPT these days. 2019 Microsoft launched the tuning natural language generate generative language model. And then 2020 GPT three came up 170 5 billion parameters, and it could generate human like text models. 2021 there is a doll e multi modal system that came up, which can actually generate image from text prompt, right? So, so this one like, you can say, hey, Paint me a Picture of a of a river flowing in front of a mountain, right? And it will actually come up with a picture for you, right? And it will not just copy and paste a picture like, it's not like a trick to basically just take your word and do a Google search and come up with a picture of river flowing in front of mountain. No, it will actually create a original picture based on based on what you specify, right? So that happened in 2021, and then basically different version of Chad, GPT can started coming 3.5 GPT four, and there is basically no end to it, right? One thing I don't know whether you guys have noticed, probably you have that like these days when you do Google search, does it look and feel very different from what it used to be, even couple of years back. So what do you see when you do a Google search today? The top of the search right? So you will see that it actually shows a AI generated result with a little disclaimer that it's still an experimental technology. So you should take what you hear with grains of salt. But more often than not, I have seen like if I want to see like hey, whether, let's say, like, any, any type of question, like, sometimes I kind of ask random question, like, what kind of food are more known to cause heartburn or cancer or something, right? So earlier, a couple of years back, when you asked the question like this, some of the first result you will see that, okay, there is a link to Mayo Clinic website, right? And you go, go to that Mayo Clinic website, and you read it yourself these days, you will see that using these generative AI technology behind the scene, the search engines will actually give you a nice, comprehensive answer that you can read. And if you are not trying to get too deep into it. If you just want a good enough answer to be, you know, just to be able to hold a conversation in a dinner party for most of the time, you're good with that, right? And there are good and bad things about it, right? So, so you need to be little careful, but, but this is something that you, you have, I'm sure are experiencing these days, right. Cool. Any, any question, comments, thought, any one of you like to add? I

Speaker 2  1:09:43  
can I ask a question? Sure, go ahead. Daniel,

Speaker 6  1:09:47  
so you went through the briefly, some of the history of AI development. Will that be something we're going to use as a reference? Point to our own development or

Speaker 2  1:10:03  
no. But one thing you could use so you will see these weeks challenge assignment is for you to write kind of an essay, right? The focus of the essay is basically to do your own research and find a company that uses AI in their business in some shape or form, right? And then do your own research, use your Google search, Wikipedia, your own reading, or even Chad GPT based search, for that matter, right? And then, and then come up with a case study like how a particular company or business uses AI right in its in its to basically either run its core business or gain competitive advantage or whatnot, right? So you could use some of these in your research if you need to. But I basically wanted to talk about this just to kind of generate interest and kind of slowly go into kind of a definition of what AI is, right? And as you probably have noted, we I use lot of terms, right? I use logic theory. I use the terms like, neural network, conventional neural network, right? So hopefully that will actually create some interest in your mind, like, Oh, I heard this term, conventional convolutional neural network, right? Or transformer architecture. Let me do some search and see what that is all about. Right? Some of these you will actually do hands on as we go to the later part of the course, right? So that's why I just wanted you to kind of at least hear some of the words that are kind of important and floats around in the industry, right? So, cool. Okay, so let's take a little pause here and try to come up with a definition of what artificial intelligence is. So what you are seeing in the screen, what it reads is that AI is the combined application of the computer and data sciences to develop algorithms that can execute autonomous problem solving. So think about what it says, right? It says, What are the keywords here, autonomous problem solving, right? And it also talks about application of computer and data sciences to develop algorithms so so basically, according to these definition, AI is an algorithm that solves problems on its own. Do you guys agree to this definition, or do you think something can be added or changed to this definition based on your understanding of AI, and you could be wrong, because you guys are just starting on this right so, so think about it. Give it a couple of reads, and think about what your thought is about this definition of AI.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:01  
Then I'll tell you what I think.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:02  
We be able

Speaker 9  1:13:04  
to include the parts about it, being able to, like, memorize certain information now that we have the code for it? Or would that not fall under the AI category?

Speaker 2  1:13:22  
Ai, yeah, that's a good point that you brought up. But AI is not about memorization, right? Because that is kind of a more falls into the area of data. I'd say data engineering, right? When what I talked about memorization. I think what you are referring to is when I talked about this transformer architecture where I said, Oh, it can remember what it had learned before and therefore make the connection. But that is not really memorization in that sense, but that is more like being able to put things into context, right? So for example, in English language, one word can have five different meaning depending on the context that the word is used, right. So that's what I meant, right? So yes, AI is actually now very good in contextualizing thing. So I would if I want, if you would go that way, then I would rather say contextualization is a better word than memorization, okay?

Speaker 9  1:14:27  
And then also, the only other thing that I would add would be that it cannot be like, detected as like anything outside of a human, similar to what we wrote about at the beginning. Did I write it down? You know how Alan Turing has his

Unknown Speaker  1:14:49  
distinguishable that cannot be distinguishable?

Speaker 2  1:14:52  
Yeah, yeah. So that's, that's an interesting point you brought up, right? So let's, let's talk about that. So do you think that is. Is, do you actually agree to Alan Turing's definition that in order for something to be called AI, it needs to be indistinguishable from human Yes, okay, um, Connie, I see you have raised a hand. You want to add something?

Unknown Speaker  1:15:17  
Yeah, I was just say that

Unknown Speaker  1:15:21  
it doesn't make

Speaker 10  1:15:26  
values based. It doesn't answer

Unknown Speaker  1:15:31  
based according to its own values.

Speaker 10  1:15:35  
Doesn't develop opinions the way humans do yes in my so that's my opinion, that until, until something is developed that can actually do that, then it's, then there's, that's the difference between humans, human output and artificial intelligence. Very

Speaker 2  1:15:55  
true, very true, very true. And, and we are, you are absolutely right, right? We are nowhere close to that, right? And we will talk about that in a little bit. Okay, so now let's look at the next definition, and this is from IBM. So IBM says AI is a technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human learning, comprehension, problem solving, decision making, creativity and autonomy, which is kind of not very, I'd say, unlike the previous definition, where it is trying to define from in a more rigorous manner, like what AI is, this is kind of a more generic description of why AI should be. And I would say, My opinion is that I would agree to all of this, except for the last one. Autonomy, creativity, I'd say, yeah, kind of I'll give it a 5050, maybe, yeah, 0.5 like some of you guys said in your programming knowledge. So creativity, I'd say 0.5 autonomy, absolutely not, no matter what, Elon Musk leads us to believe that he has he's almost made autonomous car, but those are not autonomous. And the why is that? Because even though a robot or a car seems to be moving in an autonomous manner, it is not autonomous because it is always guided by objective a goal. And the goal in that case is a very singular goal, like, hey, you need to move these, move yourself from point A to point B, avoiding any collision or crash in the safest way possible. That's a goal, and it is basically simply just doing whatever it can, doing all this problem solving, do it now, doing all this decision making to achieve that goal. But that is not really autonomy. Autonomy would be something where you basically unleash a robot on the field, and robot decides on its own what to do, much like when we go out through the door, no one tells us what to do, right? We are free to do whatever we want to do, right? So, so it's not autonomy. But other than that, I think we still have, we already have, kind of a comprehension, almost human level, comprehension, of understanding. We do have problem solving abilities, almost human, like, in some sense, decision making. Yes, if you can basically create an AI model with lot of good data, then yes, it can make a decision. But within the within a very limited context of decision making, right? Like, if you will, if you create a AI to make decision, let's say, financial decision for you, and then suddenly you ask the same AI to make a medical decision for you, it will fail miserably, right? Because you can only create and train AI for a limited purpose and the limited scope within very well defined boundaries. Hmm?

Speaker 2  1:19:05  
Cool. I see your hand still up. Connie, you want to add something? Yeah, I

Speaker 10  1:19:09  
was just wondering, well, a comment that depends on what definition, what your definition of creativity is, too, because when I what I see AI doing is just taking, assembling from from things that it's our, that it's seen, and just but it doesn't create anything new outside of

Speaker 2  1:19:30  
it does not outside of boundary, correct? So

Speaker 10  1:19:34  
I think there's probably, there's different ways to define creativity, but it doesn't create, it doesn't create the Sistine Chapel or something like that. No, it

Unknown Speaker  1:19:45  
does not. It does not that is,

Speaker 4  1:19:46  
that's a very interesting question, actually, too, I would add, I'm thinking about that back in as sort of computer science. Even further back, Lovelace, it was probably the first computer pro. Grammar

Unknown Speaker  1:20:01  
Correct. A long time ago,

Speaker 4  1:20:04  
you said, Well, you know, computers will be able to handle more than math. They'll be able to do things like music as long as we can make it to numbers. But Shane says that there would never be any creativity. Turing tend to disagree with that, but I was just thinking. I was listening the other day to to Sharon Lanier, I think is a very interesting computer scientist. And he was talking about, where are, like generative models now being creative? And he said, Well, it's because, let's say the first thing I've ever prompted when this one of those models was make a picture of my cat. And he would say, well, it knows cats, because as trained on lots of pictures of cats, it knows what the surface of Mars, because we have beautiful photos now of Mars, and it's trained a lot of those. But for to put my cat, a cat on Mars, means to kind of do a certain amount of creativity, where you make those relationships between them that don't normally exist. So it does that kind of creativity. But it's not like you're saying it's not creating a scene chapel, and it does not have the volition to create something of its own. It's because we give it a prompt.

Speaker 2  1:21:21  
Yeah, very true. And then the next stop is Google's definition of AI, where they say it's a field of science concerned with building computers and machine that can reason, learn and act in such a way that would normally require human intelligence, but that involves data whose scale exceeds what humans can analyze. What do you think about this definition? I

Unknown Speaker  1:22:03  
any thoughts comments on this? Yes, go ahead, Daniel, I think

Speaker 6  1:22:05  
it's getting a little bit closer to freedom for creativity. The only problem is, we're using the human experience to compare AI so that we can say, yeah, that's alive, or that's not alive. You know, we have the biasness of the human condition that we're using, and we have to use it. That's where, this is our first starting point. But that's also our limitations as well.

Speaker 2  1:22:32  
Yeah. But one thing I like about this definition is kind of towards the end, as it says, in such a way that would normally require a human intelligence, or that involves data whose scale exceeds what humans can analyze, right? Because it is talking about being able to reason, being able to learn, being able to add, it does not explicitly say being able to take decision. But I think that is kind of implicit in this definition, but when it has to do a machine has to do all of these by using data at a scale that human cannot do, exceeding humans care, and that, I would say, is kind of much closer to what You will be learning and practicing throughout this boot camp. So these, I'd say, is a more closer to, like, if you, if you take all of those kind of, you know, forward looking things away, like, hey, where AI would be able to write your poetry, and why not, right? But that's not what we are here to talk about and learn, right? But this is probably what here we will see that will actually work in problems where we provide the machine with data, lots and lots of data, and then machine can analyze and find the pattern, and based on that pattern, then the machine can actually take, come out, arrive at a structured decision, Right, which would not have been possible otherwise by humanly crunching all those data no matter what. So I'd say this is kind of much more closer what you ought to do. Dex, you have your hands up. Go ahead.

Speaker 11  1:24:14  
Yeah, this one might come through. Okay, yes, it is. Okay. That's good, yeah, I mean, and I kind of, I kind of really agree, I think a lot closer with, with Google's sort of interpretation of it, because I think a lot of the things that we use AI for nowadays are, like, I said, like, like, when the days is, like, far too fast, like, if it's okay, well, we want to recommend the next best YouTube video for someone because we want to increase engagement, keep people on the site for longer. It's there's so many different data points for what makes a video a good video,

Speaker 2  1:24:53  
that or interesting or relevant video for someone

Speaker 11  1:24:57  
Exactly, yeah, and so you're never. To get to the point where, like, a human's going to be able to look at and be like, oh yeah, this part here, and like, all of these different data points for all of the like, I think there's something crazy, like 200 gigabytes uploaded every second to YouTube. It's just you're never going to be able to get to that point. But I like that better than the creativity, because as far as I'm aware, and maybe, maybe I'm out of date with this, but I'm pretty sure that we haven't been able to train any AI on any generated content from other AI like, it just starts to, like, break down when you do that. So there might just be something fundamental that it's not getting and I think when you can get it to the point to where it's able to train itself on its own data, or on data made from other large like other, you know, neural networks. At that point, you might be able to say it has creativity, but I don't think it's like at that point yet. So I don't, I don't think that's like, a definition I would use yet,

Unknown Speaker  1:25:57  
correct, yes, yep,

Unknown Speaker  1:26:03  
Edin, I think I see your hands up,

Speaker 12  1:26:05  
yeah, my mic coming through. Yes, fantastic. So I think that the biggest differentiation between what the biggest hurdle that AI is going to have to overcome is ingenuity. It's it's that leap from a pre established decision tree of what fits best to actually creating a new branch on the tree without any kind of prompting. And that's what we're missing right now. And that's one of the that's one of the reasons why? When we try and train an AI with an AI, it starts breaking down. Why AIS just they large language generators like Chad, GPT, they start to break down, or will just give the best fit answer that it can come up with at that time, even if it's completely wrong, it's it's so easy to ask perplexity or chat GPT to help with something, and you really need to double check its work because it, I've been able to break it within within three questions. Oh, yes. So it's, it's, it's, we're not quite to the part. What we're missing is the engine ingenuity, which is something that our brains just do,

Speaker 4  1:27:26  
yeah, actually, actually, there's a Sam Altman for open AI gave a list of the stages would be necessary to achieve AGI, which is artificial general intelligence. And the last one is exactly that that event. So and according to his scheme, we're maybe at level two out of I think it's five. Yeah.

Speaker 2  1:27:58  
Does anyone else, by the way, I don't think I see all of you on the screen, because this is large class. So if any of you have your hands on, but I cannot see you. Wow, there's like 123, screens full of people here. Anyone else have their hands on? Want to add something? I was just gonna come Yeah, I

Unknown Speaker  1:28:21  
wanted to go ahead. Sorry.

Speaker 13  1:28:26  
One thing that struck me with this impact to your point that you mentioned about involves data whose scale exceeds that, what humans can analyze. I think one major use case for AI, and a big problem that it solves is the analysis of big data. It's always been a big question of, how do we look at, how do we capture big data and actually make it useful? Because there's so much data out there that just hasn't been mined, can't be mined, and I think that that that last line kind of speaks to that use case of humans won't be able to really tap into that, but AI could,

Speaker 2  1:29:06  
yep, and you would be surprised to hear that most companies, I'd say, almost all companies, today, are sitting on probes of data, which, as we mentioned, we call big data, but most companies are very ill equipped to actually make any sense out of the data, and this These include some of the very, very well known corporations that we deal with, and still, they have no clue what to do with this data, right? And that is one thing I do in my day job, like I talked about, some of the strategic advisory that I do, right? One of the services that we provide is basically, we call it AI readiness, right? So where we basically go, and let's say the CIO invites us as a consultant to basically look into the data that their amount of data that they are sitting on, and what to do with that data, right, come up with their strategy, right? So companies are not well equipped to do. That, right? And, but that's a different problem, though, that's that's a different kind of business problem. That's not really a technology problem. We do have tools to do analytics, and none of, not all of these has to be classified as AI, right? I mean, lot of insight can be mined using plain, simple, old statistical techniques, right? Using analytics, but that's kind of a different the companies cannot do what do not know. What they do is mostly because they're kind of a swamp with the data, right? Like, as you mentioned, like, like, every second, like, what 200 terabytes of data is being produced? Like, what do we do with this? I
